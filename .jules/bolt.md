## 2024-07-25 - Lazy Loading `PropertyModal`

**Learning:** Successfully implemented lazy loading for the `PropertyModal` component in `Projects.tsx` using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`. This is a great pattern for improving initial page load times by deferring the loading of components that are not immediately visible.

**Action:** Look for other opportunities to apply lazy loading to components that are conditionally rendered or appear further down the page.
